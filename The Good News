The Good News is all about the coming of our savior

If you don't believe there is someone greater than anything in this world
You have to believe it 

The good news says that Jesus is coming soon
And you have to give your life to Christ if you don't want to end up in hell

Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand

Let who has ear hear what the spirit has said
